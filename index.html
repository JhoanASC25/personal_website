             Hello, my name is Jhoan Alonso. Im currently a rising 12th grader next year at Frederick Douglass Academy. Sometimes I think of cool ideas in my head, like recreating or making a game, but I can never execute my ideas because of my lack of knowledge around coding. I am currentlly enrolled at "AllStarCode" in order to overcome this problem. I hope you enjoy this!!

            <h1>Free Time</h1>
            <p>
                I am a very free person. What I mean by this is that my schendule is almost always open. Because of this, im usually playing games, watching videos or shows, talking to friends, or just chilling at home. I get bored very easily. which is why I try to implement myself in many new things! For example, last year I attended 2 weekly programs that helped my drawing skills, and a basic understanding of code. Even as of now, I joined AllStarCode because of how much free time I have and wanted to learn new stuff that can hopefully provide useful for me in the future! My favorite games are "Terraria" "Hollow Knight" and "War Thunder". Some of my favorite YouTubers are "Joe Bartolozzi" "PenguinZ0" and "EmortalMarcus"

            <h1>Family</h1>
            <p>
                My family is everything to me. Without them, I wouldnt be the person I am today. They always try their best to sway me away from bad decisions that I can potentially make. Although their too overprotective, I understand that they just love me too much. Both my Mother and Father are from Ecuador, Sadly due to many reasons, it has been around 7 years since we revisted.. Whenever im at my lowest point in life, or when im just about to quit, they stop me. understanding that giving up isint easy, but it "doesnt suit me at all". Those words have helped me push foward time and time again. I wiill forever be in their debt.

        <h1>Future</h1>
        <p>
            Ever since I was an elemntary schooler in the 4th grade (around 9 years ago), I had my eyes set on a specific career. This career is still my dream job, an airline pilot. Back then, I woudl always dress up as a pilot at any chance I got, Halloween? Pilot. Costume Parade? Pilot. Even today I still have that same Pilot outfit. The only issue is that my family is relativley "less economically" blessed, On average, our household brings $50,000 a year. However, on average, studying for Aviation and getting all your liscenses (Private Pilot, Comercial Pilot, Certified Flight instructor) cost $100,000+ including training. Because of this. My plan is to grind grind and grind for scholarships and HOPEFULLY it'll work out...
